                <h3><b>Tokyo Story</b></h3>
                <p>Yasujir&otilde; Ozu | 1953 | 136 minutes</p>
                <p>&ldquo;A profoundly stirring evocation of elemental humanity and universal heartbreak, Tokyo Story is the crowning achievement of the unparalleled Yasujiro Ozu. The film, which follows an aging couple&rsquo;s journey to visit their grown
                    children in bustling postwar Tokyo, surveys the rich and complex world of family life with the director&rsquo;s customary delicacy and incisive perspective on social mores. Featuring lovely performances from Ozu regulars Chishu Ryu
                    and Setsuko Hara, Tokyo Story plumbs and deepens the director&rsquo;s recurring theme of generational conflict, creating what is without question one of cinema&rsquo;s mightiest masterpieces.&rdquo;

                <p><b>Chantal Akerman | 1975 | 201 minutes</b></p>
                <p>&ldquo;A singular work in film history, Chantal Akerman&rsquo;s <em>Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</em> meticulously details, with a sense of impending doom, the daily routine of a middle-aged widow, whose chores
                    include making the beds, cooking dinner for her son, and turning the occasional trick. In its enormous spareness, Akerman&rsquo;s film seems simple, but it encompasses an entire world. Whether seen as an exacting character study or
                    as one of cinema&rsquo;s most hypnotic and complete depictions of space and time, Jeanne Dielman is an astonishing, compelling movie experiment, one that has been analyzed and argued over for decades.&rdquo;

                <h3>Do the Right Thing</h3>
                <p><b>Spike Lee | 1989 | 120 minutes</b></p>
                <p>&ldquo;Set on one block of Brooklyn&rsquo;s Bed&ndash;Stuy Do or Die neighborhood, at the height of summer, this 1989 masterpiece by Spike Lee confirmed him as a writer and filmmaker of peerless vision and passionate social engagement.
                    Over the course of a single day, the easygoing interactions of a cast of unforgettable characters&mdash;Da Mayor, Mother Sister, Mister Se&ntilde;or Love Daddy, Tina, Sweet Dick Willie, Buggin Out, Radio Raheem, Sal, Pino, Vito, and
                    Lee&rsquo;s Mookie among them—give way to heated confrontations as tensions rise along racial fault lines, ultimately exploding into violence. Punctuated by the anthemic refrain of Public Enemy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fight the Power,&rsquo;
                    <em>Do the Right Thing</em> is a landmark in American cinema, as politically and emotionally charged and as relevant now as when it first hit the big screen.&rdquo;

                <h3>Mishima&#58; A Life in Four Chapters</h3>
                <p><b>Paul Schrader | 1985 | 120 minutes</b></p>
                <p>&ldquo;Paul Schrader&rsquo;s visually stunning, collagelike portrait of the acclaimed Japanese author and playwright Yukio Mishima &#40;played by Ken Ogata&#41; investigates the inner turmoil and contradictions of a man who attempted the
                    impossible task of finding harmony among self, art, and society. Taking place on the last day of Mishima&rsquo;s life, when he famously committed public seppuku, the film is punctuated by extended flashbacks to the writer&rsquo;s past
                    as well as gloriously stylized evocations of his fictional works. With its rich cinematography by John Bailey, exquisite sets and costumes by Eiko Ishioka, and unforgettable, highly influential score by Philip Glass, <em></em>Mishima&#58;
                    A Life in Four Chapters
                    </em> is a tribute to its subject and a bold, investigative work of art in its own right.&rdquo;

                <h3>Stalker</h3>
                <p><b>Andrei Tarkovsky| 1979 | 161 minutes</b></p>
                <p> &ldquo;Andrei Tarkovsky&rsquo;s final Soviet feature is a metaphys­ical journey through an enigmatic postapocalyptic landscape, and a rarefied cinematic experience like no other. A hired guide&mdash;the Stalker&mdash;leads a writer and
                    a professor into the heart of the Zone, the restricted site of a long-ago disaster, where the three men eventually zero in on the Room, a place rumored to fulfill one&rsquo;s most deeply held desires. Adapting a science&ndash;fiction
                    novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, Tarkovsky created an immersive world with a wealth of material detail and a sense of organic atmosphere. A religious allegory, a reflection of contemporaneous political anxieties, a meditation
                    on film itself&mdash;Stalker envelops the viewer by opening up a multitude of possible meanings.&rdquo;
